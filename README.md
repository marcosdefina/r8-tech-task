## Description
Plot data in a simple DOM using Plotly.js

## Data Interpretation

  - **15361 - Orange Chart** - Follows the expected climate data for the North East of Europe, as we can see [here](https://en.climate-data.org/europa/estonia/tallinn/tallinn-601/).
  - **15360 - Blue Chart** - Ventilation unit cooling coil - The only charts with abrupt changes, and values varying between 0 an 100.
  - **17006 - Red Chart** - Room temperature - As the unity cooling system is turned on only in hot wheater, the purpose can only be to refrigerate. Discarded the possibility of warming ventilation, the only possibility to the Room temperature is the hotter one.
  -  **15377 - Green Graph** - Ventilation unit supply - The same logic of the Red Chart, but with the inverse purpose, the only possibility of a cooling unity supply is to be cooler than the room temperature.
